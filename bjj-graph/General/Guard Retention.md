Note based on [this material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToKDHylpgDY&t=274s&ab_channel=JonThomasBJJ). Focus on situation when you are lying with your back on the floor. Simplest transition to make is to go to the [[Sitting (bottom)]], but this is described in a separate note.

## Maintain centered hips
Idea here is not to allow your opponent to move left / right with respect to your hips. You can have them tilted, when your opponent moves, but facing his direction!

## Elbow knee connection
Always try to maintain elbow-knee connection
![[guard-retention2-img.png|400]]
When you keep elbow and knee tight it is very difficult to pass to the side control.
## Outside leg to re-center
When opponent goes left / right don't use the leg closer to him to re-center your position! Instead use the outside leg. This requires more flexibility, but allows you **to keep your elbow-knee connection**, while giving you a chance to recover your guard.
## Centering using your arms
If your opponent stands close to you with his legs, you can ise your arms to help you spin into right position ([[#Maintain centered hips]]).

## Elbow frame to center your hips
Generally you want to avoid your legs being squashed / turned. Doing that only with your leg muscles is virtually impossible, but when you put your elbows on the floor and use your arms as a support for your legs it will be much harder to turn them to the side.

## Forward shrimp
When you make a mistake and allow your opponent to turn you into wrong direction, you can use your outer leg to do "forward shrimp" motion in order to recenter your position. For the technique explanation just watch [this fragment](https://youtu.be/ToKDHylpgDY?t=204) of the video.
## Under leg reset
Again, when opponent turns your hips to one side, you can try to re-center your position by catching this small hook (when you can't use [[#Outside leg to re-center]]):

This hook can help you to create space, shrimp out and resetting the position.
## Active high legs
When being in centered position, try to keep your legs active. Don't keep then too low (easy guard pass), and don't keep them too high (you can get stacked). Think that your feet are rifles and you should point them in the middle of your opponent's chest. Try to keep around 45 degree bend.

Be active. Move your feet around, make small circles. Make gripping them difficult. Also it is a good practice to avoid having both feet up at the same time - you can get stacked. Having one leg high and another one low is much safer. 
## Deflect grips with your hands
Use your hands to deflect opponent's initial grips. Main purpose is not to directly get our grips but to make it harder to grab us. Eventually, you should use this as a way to get good grips for our guard. Remember, that our primary goal is not to defend, but to **enter our guard and start our offense**.
## Sitting up
When your opponent gives you some space (backs up), just do a [[technical sit up]], and start playing [[Sitting (bottom)]] (or stand up and continue fighting on your legs).
## Maintain distance when sitting
When sitting it is crucial to maintain proper distance. Don't let your opponent get to close to you. Scoot back when you need it. 
## Develop basic open guards
Develop some open guards to know what to look for!
