# Position overview

Main idea of this position is control of opponent's collar and sleeve simutaneusly:
![[collar-sleeve-overview1-img.png|600]]
Let's consider image above as an example. For the grip on the collar, it should be rather high, best just above the collar bone.

For the right foot the best place is to put it in opponent's left biceps and try to control his arm. For more details see this [link](https://youtu.be/PKQEms4w9T4?t=71).

**Entering the position**
- **sitting vs standing**
	- Tip from [this video](https://youtu.be/IHgdNWKK1yM?t=49) is to firstly get the grips with our hands, then fall back and try to set up collar sleeve with lasso (left leg lasso, right on the biceps).
- **standing vs standing**
	- Establish upper body grips. Then you can also go directly to leg on hip, but in this case beware of people trying to grab your leg (pull their sleeve towards your chest to make it difficult)

**Some general rules:**
* **do not allow your opponent to get a grip on your left leg**. If he does so (with his right arm break it immediately!). If he does so with his left arm, shoot for the triangle (TODO add reference to video)
* **stay centered**. When you stay centered you have most power. When you move left / right you gives your opponent a chance to setup a pass.
* **keep your right leg out of his reach**. If he manages to push down your right foot, make a lasso with your left leg and use it to push away your opponent. Be aggressive with it!


For now, consider that opponent is standing. 
# Variants
There are variants of this position based on (left) leg positioning:
- [[#De la riva hook]]
- [[#Lasso]]
- [[#Foot on the hip]]
The strongest variant of this position is with [Foot on the hip](#Foot%20on%20the%20hip). Lasso is mainly used for defense purposes (see [Lasso](#Lasso) section).


## De la riva hook

### Sweeps
1. [[Overhead sweep]] 
2. [[#Off-balance]]

#### Off-balance
To off-balance your opponent place your right foot somewhere on his chest. Use it alongside with your upper body to force opponent to your left. This move is a good entrance to further attacks. There are few options that can happen

### Submissions
1. [[Triangle choke]]
2. [[Omoplata]]
## Lasso
When opponents manages to kill our right leg (and starts to push it down in between his legs) we need to establish shallow lasso with our left leg. This can prevent different passes e.g. ([[Knee cut pass]], [[X pass]]). If you fail with applying lasso, and your opponent starts to knee cut, use his sleeve (extend your arm) to limit his mobility and try to reset ([link](https://youtu.be/ScDTeUCQ-Mg?t=419)).
After freeing right leg, try to put it back into opponent's biceps and you can switch to [Foot on the hip](#Foot%20on%20the%20hip) or [De la riva hook](#De%20la%20riva%20hook).

## Foot on the hip

**Basic defense against passing**
People will often try to pass this guard by moving left/right. When that happens, use your left leg (with foot on the hip) to post on the opp's hip and move your hips to follows your opponent.

**Distance management**
Don't overextend your leg - this will allow your opponent to pass

### Submissions
- [[Triangle choke]]
- [[Omoplata]]
