Also called a **knee slide pass**.
How to setup a knee cut pass depends on grips your opponents have.


A knee cut pass is when we pass with our opponent's leg pinned to the floor. Then the core idea is to rotate his upper body into opposite direction (see image below):

How to rotate his upper body (main ways):
- underhook + chest pressure
- cross collar grip (+ forearm pressure on his face)
- pulling his right sleeve up 
- your left arm crossface







## 1 Opponent's flat and on his side
Ideal starting position:
![[Knee cut pass-3.png|500]]
When you see an opening as shown above just drop into following position:

Remember about:
- pinning his leg to the floor with your right shin
- blocking his left leg with your right forearm and shoulder
- shooting with your right arm for opponent's left lapel (though it's more important to have your arm as a frame rather than actually grabbing his lapel)
All the above should really spread his legs and even make it a bit uncomfortable for less flexible guys.
### 1.1 Countering Lasso defense
It's common to use lasso as a form of defense (opponent loops his left leg in front of our right shoulder).

Steps:
1. circle back
2. pressure with your right elbow (see image below)
3. try to get your head under his foot
4. jump with your knee into free space (see image below)

You can use your left hand to control opponent's right leg.
See more detailed description of passing Lasso here: [[Lasso (top)]] (or here [[Colar sleeve (top)]].

> [!tip] Tip
> Remember to keep knee and elbow tight (to prevent omoplata)! You can also use your right knee to put even more pressure.

### 1.2 Knee shield
This refers to the most common case when your opponent's  using his top knee as a shield. It's most commonly used by people who like to play [[Half guard (bottom)]]. When that happens it's difficult to grab the lapel, as they can just use their leg to push us away.

In such case it's a good idea to control opponent's top leg. It might not be always easy (they'll definitely try to rip this grip off).

**When you control top leg remember you can always threaten other passes!**
Ideal follow up from this position is to drop down to your knee while grabbing opponent's collar and pushing down his leg (behind you). [See this fragment (~15s) for more details](https://youtu.be/lOPh9K5kOcE?t=311) .

When you can't push his leg you can still engage. Just drop your knee into the space between his hips and armpit (see image below) and again try to grab their collar (which also will be difficult as they should frame).

If you manage to set up this position, try to still push their leg back.
## 2 Opponent's flat and centered
Starting position:
![[Knee cut pass-2.png|500]]
In this case it's usually more difficult to get into knee cut. It is a good idea to initially threaten with passes like [[Torreando pass]] or [[Stack pass]].
