Also called a **knee slide pass**.
How to setup a knee cut pass depends on grips your opponents have.


A knee cut pass is when we pass with our opponent's leg pinned to the floor. Then the core idea is to rotate his upper body into opposite direction (see image below):
![[Knee cut pass-1.png | 500]]


How to rotate his upper body (main ways):
- underhook + chest pressure
- cross collar grip (+ forearm pressure on his face)
- pulling his right sleeve up 
- your left arm crossface


## 1 Opponent's flat and on his side
Ideal starting position:
![[Knee cut pass-3.png|400]]
When you see an opening as shown above just drop into following position:
![[Knee cut pass-4.png|400]]
Remember about:
- pinning his leg to the floor with your right shin
- blocking his left leg with your right forearm and shoulder
- shooting with your right arm for opponent's left lapel (though it's more important to have your arm as a frame rather than actually grabbing his lapel)
All the above should really spread his legs and even make it a bit uncomfortable for less flexible guys.
### 1.1 Countering Lasso defense
It's common to use lasso as a form of defense (opponent loops his left leg in front of our right shoulder). 
![[Knee cut pass-5.png|450]]
Steps:
1. circle back
2. pressure with your right elbow (see image below)
3. try to get your head under his foot
4. jump with your knee into free space (see image below)
 
![[Knee cut pass-7.png | 450]]
You can use your left hand to control opponent's right leg.
See more detailed description of passing Lasso here: [[Lasso (top)]] (or here [[Colar sleeve (top)]].

> [!tip] Tip
> Remember to keep knee and elbow tight (to prevent omoplata)! You can also use your right knee to put even more pressure.

### 1.2 Knee shield
This refers to the most common case when your opponent's  using his top knee as a shield. It's most commonly used by people who like to play [[Half guard (bottom)]]. When that happens it's difficult to grab the lapel, as they can just use their leg to push us away.
![[Knee cut pass-8.png | 450]]
In such case it's a good idea to control opponent's top leg. It might not be always easy (they'll definitely try to rip this grip off).
![[Knee cut pass-9.png | 450]]
**When you control top leg remember you can always threaten other passes!**
Ideal follow up from this position is to drop down to your knee while grabbing opponent's collar and pushing down his leg (behind you). [See this fragment (~15s) for more details](https://youtu.be/lOPh9K5kOcE?t=311) .

When you can't push his leg you can still engage. Just drop your knee (like a nail) into the space between his hips and armpit (see image below) and again try to grab their collar (which also will be difficult as they should frame).
![[Knee cut pass-10.png |500]]
If you manage to set up this position, try to still push their leg back, and then you can progress with the position.
#### 1.2.1 Toreando trap
When you threaten with [[Toreando pass]] they usually use their arm to frame and that opens the knee space. 
![[Knee cut pass-11.png|300]]![[Knee cut pass-12.png|317]]
You can then use that to enter the knee cut by shooting your right knee to this newly created space. In order to finish grab their triceps (and pull), push on their knee and slide.
![[Knee cut pass-13.png | 400]]
### 1.3 Finishing the pass
When you have your opponent's centered there are few ways to finish the pass.
#### 1.3.1 Cross collar grip
To execute this finish, change your grip from the back to the collar grip and put pressure with your forearm on opponent's neck / jaw (image on the left). Your goal is to rotate his face into the other direction (see image on the right). After getting collar grip, put your left arm forward (as a base), and slide with your knee.
![[Knee cut pass-16.png|330]] ![[Knee cut pass-17.png|325]]
If you want to see more options see [this reference (~60s)](https://youtu.be/lOPh9K5kOcE?t=490).
## 2 Opponent's flat and centered
Starting position:
![[Knee cut pass-2.png|500]]
In this case it's usually more difficult to get into knee cut. It is a good idea to initially threaten with passes like [[Toreando pass]], [[Leg drag pass]] or [[Stack pass]].

If you want to force the knee cut:
- step into De La Riva 
- trap the second leg (so you are in [[Headquarters (top)]] position)
- work from there (see [[#6 Leandro Lo knee cut|this section for a blast knee cut]]).

It's important to focus on controlling opponent's right leg (the one you want to trap later on) from the beginning. If you skip this, it might be difficult to then perform the knee cut (opponent won't give us his leg for free, and if it's on the outside you won't be able to knee cut).
See images below for a rough sketch of how it can look like.
![[Knee cut pass-34.png|335]]![[Knee cut pass-35.png|320]]

## 3 Opponent's sitting and centered 
Starting position (usually opponent will have their hands in the air, not on their knees):
![[Knee cut pass-40.png|400]]

### 3.1 Put them flat on the ground
If you manage to get your hands under your opponent's hands you can use to push on him. That should put him on his back, exactly as in [[#2 Opponent's flat and centered]].
![[Knee cut pass-36.png|225]]![[Knee cut pass-38.png|229]]![[Knee cut pass-39.png|235]]

### 3.2 Collar offense
To set up this attack do this two steps:
- grab same side collar
- step outside your opponent's leg (same side as the collar grip)
This position looks should look more or less like this:
![[Knee cut pass-41.png|400]]
Then there are 2 main ways how opponent will react.

**Option 1:** *he does nothing*
Here just continue going forward. Put your right leg forward, push opponent to the ground and use your right arm to control their left leg.
![[Knee cut pass-42.png|323]]![[Knee cut pass-43.png|360]]
See section [[#1.3 Finishing the pass]] for example finishes.

**Option 2:** *he takes his leg to the outside*
People often want to have their legs outside of our body to limit our left-right movements. Se when you step to the outside (see left image below), opponent may react with putting his leg back to the outside position (see right image below).
![[Knee cut pass-45.png|330]]![[Knee cut pass-44.png|335]]
This opens an opportunity to shoot for the knee cut on the other side.
![[Knee cut pass-46.png|310]]![[Knee cut pass-47.png|363]]
Just put your right leg forward and jump with your left knee to secure the knee cut. Remember that you don't have the underhook, so this position is far from being safe and stable (but colllar grip is strong so don't worry ;)).

### 3.3 Quick lunge
If there is a space for getting an underhood you can try to directly jump into knee cut. 
![[Knee cut pass-48.png|330]]![[Knee cut pass-50.png|328]]
If opponent keeps his elbows tight it doesn't make sense to try this move. However, when you see an opening simultaneously shoot with your arm (for underhook), and lunge with your shin (to land with it on your opponent's thigh). See images below for an illustration, and [this video](https://youtu.be/lOPh9K5kOcE?t=1090) for more detailed execution.

![[Knee cut pass-51.png|200]]![[Knee cut pass-49.png|232]]![[Knee cut pass-52.png|234]]
Even if you won't manage to pass the guard with this, it still forces your opponent on the mat, and give you more openings for other passes.
## 4 Opponent's sitting and on his side
Starting position:
![[Knee cut pass-53.png|400]]
In this position you can't just grab their collar because of their leading arm. General idea is to force your opponent's back to the mat and continue attacking from that position. To do so, you need to go around (to the side of his leading arm).
![[Knee cut pass-57.png|400]]
In order to do so you need to somehow control his leading arm. When you manage to grab it with your right arm try to push it to his chest, and at the same time transition to your right.
![[Knee cut pass-54.png|301]]![[Knee cut pass-58.png|300]]
Alternatively you can try to control his arm with both of your arms. Anyway, you want to land in a position shown on right picture below.
![[Knee cut pass-59.png|330]]![[Knee cut pass-56.png|330]]
It is almost guaranteed that from this position your opponent will fall on his back to defend (if he doesn't just go for the back).
![[Knee cut pass-60.png|350]]
When he falls, proceed with [[#2 Opponent's flat and centered|appropriate attacks]].
## 5 Common defenses
### 5.1 Single leg (or underhook) threat
This happens when they manage to get an underhook while we enter a knee cut position. It can be a regular underhook or they can underhook our leg threatening standing and attacking a [[Single leg takedown]]. **The most important principle here is to not allow our opponent's to get on his elbow!** 
To pass we need to flatten our opponent's upper body. We can do so by pulling on their sleeve and pushing on their shoulder / material on their back.
![[Knee cut pass-14.png | 300]]
Sometimes when your opponent is heavily rotated it can be very difficult to rotate him. In such case you need to somehow center him anyway. To do so lift your right knee and put it into his stomach or even right side of his body (image on the left). Use your left leg to put pressure and drive him flat. 
![[Knee cut pass-15.png | 330]]

### 5.2 Opponent is on his elbow
When opponent manages to get up on his elbow you are in danger. It's too late to chase the sleeve now, instead use pants grip to lift his leg up. In this way he won't be able to come up.
![[Knee cut pass-19.png|400]]
Then use your right knee to put him back on he floor. You need to rotate it and place into right side of your opponent's body. Stand up (on your toes) to free your right leg a bit. Rotate it and  push to the right. More details [here (~40s)](https://youtu.be/lOPh9K5kOcE?t=596) 
![[Knee cut pass-20.png|300]] ![[Knee cut pass-21.png|342]]
With your right knee in the spot shown above the can't turn into you. This position can often lead to [[Quarter mount (top)]] or even [[Mount (top)]].


> [!tip] Be careful!
> You need to protect your left leg from giving up a [[Deep half guard]] To do so try to keep it back like on the image below:
> ![[Knee cut pass-22.png|300]] ![[Knee cut pass-23.png|273]]
> When they are really stubborn with going for Deep half guard remember to pull on pants grip (towards you), this will make it extra hard for them to roll under you.


### 5.3 Lapel defense
Sometimes opponent's will feed your lapel to their "underhook" hand as shown on the image below. In this position (but also in general) they can bump you forward and come up. To do so effectively they need to control you left sleeve, therefore **be very careful with giving them this grip.**
![[Knee cut pass-24.png|330]]
When you control their sleeve if you want to stay safe, posture up and don't lean forward too much. Moreover use your left leg for balance (you can have it placed a but in front of you, to counter this bumps). 

In order to pass someone with a lapel in their hand, you don't do anything special. When you grab their sleeve try to grab from outside - it's a much stronger grip than grabbing from the inside. You can also use your left leg as a balance.
![[Knee cut pass-28.png|400]]
Then as explained in [[### 5.1 Single leg (or underhook) threat|this section]] you need to center your opponent before moving to actual pass. When you mange to do so get your underhook / cross collar grip and slowly grind through. His grip should eventually weaken. Don't rush this pass when they have a lapel.

Bump to sweep can look as follows:
![[Knee cut pass-26.png|228]]![[Knee cut pass-25.png|231]]![[Knee cut pass-27.png|238]]
1. They grab your sleeve
2. They bump you with their left leg (you don't have a proper base)
3. As a consequence you need to post with your right arm (otherwise you faceplant)
4. They grab your (right) triceps and come up for a sweep

>[!tip] Remember
>When you fight against single leg grip be very careful with giving up a sleeve grip. Even when you do so, don't forget about keeping a proper base.

### 5.4 Reverse De La Riva
When they get you in reverse De La Riva guard you main focus is to drag their left (top) leg back, pass your body. It prevents them from inverting.
Your other arm can hold their lapel or you can put it on the mat.
![[Knee cut pass-30.png|330]]![[Knee cut pass-29.png|318]]

When they get frustrated and let go of your collar to break your pants grip you can use [[Longstep pass]].
![[Knee cut pass-33.png|195]]![[Knee cut pass-31.png|230]]![[Knee cut pass-32.png|233]]
If they stick to keeping your collar wit stiff arm, just try to work on pushing their leg back  (behind you) and popping out their hook.  After that you can continue with a knee cut.
## 6 Leandro Lo knee cut
[reference video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-EkG0lvI-8&list=WL&index=26&ab_channel=JonThomasBJJ)
This is a very dynamic version of a knee cut. Let's discuss how to set it up from [[Headquarters (top)]] position, how to time it from there and how you can do a fast version of this cut.
### 6.1 Headquarters
Starting position:
![[Knee cut pass-69.png|400]]
The general idea is to open his knee to the outside, then go for a knee cut with and an underhook. There are many essential details that make this pass work.

**For the right leg** you want to firstly lift it up from the floor and the shoot forward to land it on opponent's chest. Then it's easier to turn him to left / right.
![[Knee cut pass-70.png|307]]![[Knee cut pass-71.png|300]]
See [this fragment](https://youtu.be/b-EkG0lvI-8?t=155) for more details.

**With your left arm** you want to open his hips to make space for your leg. Cup the knee and pull it to the outside. This should center his hips. Then step out with your left leg, and put a bit more weight on it. See images below.
![[Knee cut pass-73.png|352]]![[Knee cut pass-74.png|320]]

**For the underhook**: don't go outside the knee with your arm. You want to establish an underhook with your arm inside the opponent's knee. See image below.
![[Knee cut pass-72.png|300]]
With this way you won't get blocked by their knee shield.

**In a perfect knee cut** you want to land in chest to chest position (and not on the left side of the opponent). This makes it much more difficult to push you off.
![[Knee cut pass-75.png|400]]

You want to have your head up during this pass. When your head is up your knee is heavy, and is does good job of opening your opponent's hips.

For finishing tips see [this fragment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-EkG0lvI-8&list=WL&index=31&ab_channel=JonThomasBJJ).
### 6.2 Timing
You can set up this pass as described above but sometimes people panic and pull hard on your collar. This is the perfect timing to hit this pass, as they can literally pull you into the knee cut.

### 6.3 Fast version

## 7 Other ideas
### 7.1 Attack when they sit up
When people sit up (from lying with their back on the ground) they often expose space, so it's a great opportunity to get an underhook and shoot for a knee cut.
So firstly disengage.
![[Knee cut pass-61.png|300]]![[Knee cut pass-62.png|300]]
When they sit up, attack.
![[Knee cut pass-63.png|200]]![[Knee cut pass-64.png|235]]![[Knee cut pass-65.png|245]]
### 7.2 Switch lead leg
Fighting with knee shield can a troublesome, so you can try to surprise your opponent and switch your leading leg. After doing so, you just go for a knee cut, but on the other side. To change the leg, step back with your lead leg, and then step forward with your other leg.
Then, immediately move your right (lead) leg from the back to the outside of your opponent's leg (see middle image below).
![[Knee cut pass-66.png|228]]![[Knee cut pass-67.png|212]]![[Knee cut pass-68.png|201]]
You should land is a very loose [[Headquarters (top)]], but with second leg leading. From this position you can quickly attack with [[#6 Leandro Lo knee cut]].
