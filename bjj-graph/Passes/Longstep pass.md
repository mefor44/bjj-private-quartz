When opponent's doesn't control your collar, pants / ankle and opens his knee to outside (but the first two are more important) you can attack with Longstep. To do so move slightly to the left and drop to longstep:

Remember to block your opponent's right leg with your knee! Drive your head into his chest and use your right arm to either push his leg away or pin it to the floor. You can change your collar grip to full crossface for better pressure.
