## 1 [[Headquarters (top) 1]]
To get good starting position fro Torreando we need our opponent to let go of our pants / ankle grip (and maybe go for sleeve and try to break it). When that happens our right leg is free to move. Use that to back away, and simultaneously get a firm grip on their right leg with our left hand (switch from collar grip). Then you can start to Toreando.
