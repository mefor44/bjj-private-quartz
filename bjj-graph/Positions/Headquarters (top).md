## 1 Collar and pants control
To enter position push opponent's right leg in between yours. Make sure it's not easy for him to retract his left (e.g. by keeping your knees pinched or even dropping your left knee on the floor) In order to control their left leg, grab the outside material on their pants:

**Don't grab inside, because it's easier to loop over**. After grabbing try to stiff-arm your right arm and pin their shin to the floor.
Use your left hand to control their collar. This makes it more difficult to sweep you forward and counters them grabbing your collar (with their right arm).

An alternative to collar grip is cupping the knee:
![[Headquarters (top)-3.png | center | 400]]
Use this to setup different attacks (the idea is to push the knee towards you and eventually open that space). See more in [TODO]

## 2 Opponent's defense
A good defensive position from bottom is described in [[Headquarters (bottom)]]. Basically they grab your ankle / pants with their left arm and your collar with their right arm.

### 2.1 When they try to break the pants grip
![[Headquarters (top)-4.png | center | 400]]
When they switch from ankle / pants grip to your sleeve, it means your right leg is free to move. Then there are 2 options:
- [[X pass]]
- [[Toreando pass]] 

When they don't hold your leg, don't have a collar grip and open their knee you can attack with [[Longstep pass]]

### 2.2 When they turn to the other side

And they try to rotate to their right to recover knee shield or go to half guard.

When they turn, try to firstly keep their right leg extended bu pulling their leg down to the floor. Secondly use your right shin to pin their leg to the floor. This is an excellent setup for [[Knee cut pass]] or [[Longstep pass]].


## 3 Stabilize the position
A very stable position is presented below: 

![[Headquarters (top)-7.png | center | 400]]

Main points:
- pants grip
- collar grip (stiff arm)
- low base with hip pressing forward (to make it difficult for them to retract their right leg)

## 4 Smash pass vs knee cut dilemma

A very effective way of attacking is switching between knee cut and smash pass threats. In general you cannot just force the pass of your choice, but they idea is that when opponent defends one pass, he exposes himself to another one. 

> [!tip] Important!
> Depending on knee positioning of our opponent we can setup knee cut or smash passes. When you start forcing the knee inward (threatening smash pass) they often respond with opening their knee, and this is a perfect opportunity to attack with a knee cut.  

## 5 Leandro Lo knee cut
See [[Knee cut pass]] for more details.

## 6 Diving back takes
A bit more unorthodox. You can surprise your opponets with this attack, but it requires a slightly different grips. From the initial position (note that we don't have a collar grip here):
![[Headquarters (top)-9.png | 600]]
a good attack direction is to force opponent's right leg down (if you succeeded with that just sit on it and continue passing (todo, how?)). When he opens the knee to the outside, just go for the [[Knee cut pass]]. If they don't, it's a great opportunity to go for diving back take.
Change your right grip to the collar, and roll over your right shoulder ([detailed video](https://youtu.be/zz8To63Oj5U?t=801)).

After that, you should land in the following position:
![[Headquarters (top)-11.png | 600]]
Pushing down with your left leg lifts opponent's hips from the ground, and makes it possible to take the back. Then:
1. grab the material on the back,
2. push with your right leg
3. (optional) small shrimp
4. connect chest to the back
