Let's discuss performing this attack from different positions:

### Entry
[Reference video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx8bnQx2slc&ab_channel=BJJFanatics)
Entry to Omoplata should more or less like this:
![[closed-guard-omoplata1-img.png|300]]
Left arm underhooks opponent's leg, right arm holds his right sleeve, and your right leg swings to make it easier to enter Omoplata. It's crucial to break your opponent's posture. You can do this by putting your right leg on his left shoulder and bridging.
![[closed-guard-omoplata2-img.png|300]]
It's really difficult to stay upright when you do this. Then enter the Omoplata. Tuck your opponent's wrist int his body, turn into him (to make it harder to pull it out) and grab his belt / pants (hips in general) with your right hand.

Then let go of his right leg, and use your right hand grip to pull yourself up into sit up position. Try to get close to grabbing your opponent's armpit (grabbing the collar material that's there). Most important idea is to block his movement with your left arm like on the image below.

### Finish
In order to finish the submission try to put opponent flat on the ground, for instance by scooping away with your butt from the opponent. If you manage to do so, switch position to the one showed below and slowly lean over your opponent to finish the submission.

Steps summary:
1. Separate elbow-knee space
2. Break lapel grip
3. omoplata entry

We can start this sequence without having any specific placement of out left leg.
**First step is separating elbow-knee space.** 
![collar-sleeve-attack1-img|400](collar-sleeve-omoplata1-img.png)
 Kicking the biceps doesn't help much, but kicking away opponent's hip does (remember to *do this with our right leg*!). Then flare your elbow (see image above) and rotate your upper body to the right. This should **break knee-elbow space** (and remember to *use left leg to block opponents chin*!).
 
**Second step is to break lapel grip**
After breaking knee-elbow space there should be room to insert your left leg inside.
![[collar-sleeve-omoplata2-img.png|400]]
Flare your knee outside (push with it) and try to break the grip.

**Third step is Omoplata attack**
Put opponent's hand close to your hip. Kick your leg through, and then put the leg over his their back for Omoplata entry. To do so effectively it important to rotate our upper body left.
![[collar-sleeve-omoplata3-img.png|400]]
Use your heel to put pressure on opponent's back (aim is to break their posture).

### Finish
In oder to finish you need to break your opponent's posture. A good starting point is to getting useful grips. For the right hand, keep the grip on the collar to control the posture. For the left arm, grab your opponent's pants to stop potential movements. Lastly in order to block turning the arm around, try to crunch your position. See [[#Escapes]], if you want to know what escapes to expect from your opponent.

#### Quick finish
There is a chance to get a quick finish without putting them on their knees, it requires you to find a butterfly hook with your right leg (see image below).
![[collar-sleeve-omoplata4-img.png|300]]
After getting butterfly hook try to get up on your hands and this should give you a tap.
### Escapes
There are 3 main ways to escape Omoplata when standing:
- Posture up (and pull your arm out)
- Step over
- Rotate your arm



### Some common defense's counters
When you throw your leg for "shallow" omoplata (with your foot's fingers pointed upwards) your opponent might decide to jump over your head (as a form of defense, TODO, add link to cartwheel escape and make sure if it's the right naming). When you feel it coming (so one of his legs is already in the air), you can "stomp" on your leg foot and do a bridge (push into opponent's shoulder). This should redirect him into going flat on his back instead of him jumping over you.
Other "step over" counter is to go for the back. You need to time the moment right. When one of opponent legs is already over you, release your grips and switch for [[baby bolo]] position. If your opponent is leaning forward just push him and stand up instead of chasing the back.
