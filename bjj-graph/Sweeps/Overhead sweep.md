We can do this from following positions:
- [[#Collar sleeve]]



## Collar sleeve

Assume opponent's is close and tight (doesn't allow you to put your left leg on their hip). Go for [[Collar sleeve (bottom)#De la riva hook]]. Put your right leg into his stomach. Pull both your legs and arms backwards (legs towards you, arms over your head). When opponent is falling, do a backward roll and use your hips to get on top of him. Picture below ilustrates how you should pull with your arms.

Also [don't push away with your legs, this won't work](https://youtu.be/IHgdNWKK1yM?t=440).
